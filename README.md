If you use this software please consider citing the accompanying paper: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ultramic.2018.08.025

The codes in this reposiroty originates from codes that Dr. Will Lenthe shared with we during the developement stage of these codes (from the end of 2016 to May of 2017), when he was a graduate student in Professor Tresa Pollock's group, and I was a postdoc researcher in Professor Samantha Daly's group.  

The 'main stream' of the codes accommanying the aforementioned paper can be found in the repository: https://github.com/PollockGroup/ExternalScanControl.

The codes in this repository has modifications and additional functions to be used for specific equipments.  

- Commits mad prior to 4/26/2018 were for experiments in Professor Samantha Daly's lab at UCSB, using FEI Teneo SEM + NI USB 6251 BNC DAQ device.  The implementation was described in the following paper: https://doi.org/10.1007/s11340-018-0419-y   

- The more recent updates were for experiments in Professor John Allison's lab at University of Michigan, using Tescan Mira 3 SEM + NI USB 6251 BNC DAQ device.
